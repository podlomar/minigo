- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server on `http://localhost:3000` with hot module replacement.

### Building for Production

Build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run type-check
```
